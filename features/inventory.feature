Feature: "Inventory" service backend
    As an e-Commerce "Admin"
    I need a RESTful "Inventory" service
    So that I can keep track of all my "Products"

####################################################################################################
Background: Sample database records
    Given the following inventories
        | product_id    | condition | quantity  | restock_level | available |
        | 963           | new       | 5         | 1             | 1         |
        | 573           | used      | 6         | 2             | 1         |
        | 208           | open box  | 0         | 0             | 0         |
        | 208           | used      | 0         | 0             | 0         |
